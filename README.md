# Skiddle Events Page

## Task
I was tasked with building a single page front-end application which meets the requirements of a user story. The goal was to create a page which users can visit to view upcoming events and festivals.

## How I approached the task
I began by planning out the framework of the page - identifying the components I needed and how they would fit together. Next, I outlined the functionality the page would need, and planned how I would achieve this. Once I had the main points I wanted to cover I put together a numbered list of the order I wanted to complete the tasks.

## Functionality
The application has a mobile and desktop view. 

 - **Navigation:** In the mobile view, a hamburger menu opens the navigation for users, while in the desktop view, the navigation is displayed in a banner at the top.
 - **Search and Filtering:** Users can search for events via the search bar in both mobile and desktop views. Additionally, the desktop view features a filtering banner whic is currently display-only.
 - **Event Cards:** Each 'Event card' displays the event's name, date, and location. Clicking 'More info' reveals a brief description and details about the performing artists. In the mobile view, one event is shown per line, but more cards are displayed dynamically as the screen widens.

## What I would do next
If I had more time, I would:
1. Add functionality to the desktop filtering banner.
2. Improve the responsiveness of the event cards to ensure dynamic sizing across different screen widths.
3. Finally, I would add testing for the compenents which I have created.
